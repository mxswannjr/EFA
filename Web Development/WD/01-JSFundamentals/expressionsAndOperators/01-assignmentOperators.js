/* Assignment Operators
Allows you to take a variable and initialize it to some value.*/
let x = 20;

//Addition Assignment Operator
x += 1; //x = x+1
console.log(x); //21

//Subtraction Assignment Operator
x -= 1; //x = x-1
console.log(x); // Back to 20


//Multiplication Assignment Operator
x *= 2 //x = x*2
console.log(x) // 40

//Division Assignment Operator
x /= 4; //x = x/4
console.log(x) // 10


//Remainder (modulus) Assingment Operator
x %= 2; //x = x % 2
console.log(x);

//Modulus Operator
console.log(5%3); // 5/3 --> 1 2/3 --> 2
console.log(25%7);// 25/7 --> 3 4/7 --> 4

//Exponential Assingment Operator
x **= 2; //x = x^2
console.log(x);
