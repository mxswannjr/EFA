        <p> elevate my capacity of potential. ElevenFifty serves as a great tool to both enhance my knowledge base as well as network within the realm of the technological industry. My ultimate goal is to become a UX/UI Designer, which can make back-end web development tough. But if I can truly tap into this topic and become familiar with verbiage and the entire process of web development, I feel I will be much better off within my desired field -- almost like being bilingual, my delivery and communication would be competitively fluid amongst peers. That is what I truly want to take from ElevenFifty Academy. Let's see how this goes. Day by day, step by step. Line by line.</p>
